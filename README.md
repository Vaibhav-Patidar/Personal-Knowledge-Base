📘 Personal Knowledge Base (PKB)

Personal Knowledge Base (PKB) is a backend-focused learning project built using Spring Boot and MongoDB. The application provides a RESTful API to create, store, update, and retrieve knowledge entries in a structured manner. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with clean backend architecture (Controller–Service–Repository), MongoDB integration using Spring Data, partial update handling, request validation, and debugging real-world API issues. The project helped solidify my understanding of REST principles, persistence layers, and backend best practices.
